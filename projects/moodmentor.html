      MoodMentor is a VR application designed to improve mindfulness skills in
      neurodivergent adults, particularly those with Autism Spectrum Disorders,
      intellectual and developmental disabilities, and Acquired Brain Injuries.
      The project was developed in collaboration with Road to Responsibility, a
      Massachusetts nonprofit, alongside South Shore Support Services, WORK, Inc.,
      and the Arc of Bristol County.
    </p>
    <p class="about-section__bio">
      Funded by the Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services, MoodMentor
      was deployed across four Massachusetts health networks. Beta testing showed
      participants who had difficulty sustaining attention for more than a minute or
      two were able to focus for up to 10 minutes. The overwhelming majority responded
      positively, and an unexpected side effect was observed: members were visibly
      more relaxed after using the VR than they had been beforehand.

    <p class="about-section__bio">
      Clinically, mindfulness has been strongly linked to improved emotional and
      behavioral regulation and decision making. It involves observing details in
      natural and interpersonal environments, accurately describing what is being
      observed, and then taking effective action. The clinical team at Road to
      Responsibility provided guidance, and the technical team translated it into
      an immersive VR experience.
    </p>
    <p class="about-section__bio">
      Persons with ASD tend to struggle reading social cues and experience higher
      levels of stress and anxiety when interacting with others. Traditional clinical
      approaches can be helpful, but skill acquisition occurs in high-stakes real-life
      situations. VR offered a way to practice in a safe, controlled environment.
